# tiny_faceit_patcher
DEPRECATED.

Served it's purpose.

Just downloads and installs KB5029006. Makes FACEIT AC run with w10 22h2.
The ui is really basic. The app will freeze during the download. Thats how TK works when dealing with windows OS commands.
It will make a dir on the C drive called "C:\FACEIT_PATCHER". Delete it afterwards. Could have used tempfile but anyway.
Make sure to run the app as administrator.
